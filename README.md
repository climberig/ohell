This is the implementation of ["oh hell"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Hell) card game. This game has a lot of variations,
and this is the implementation of one of them.

We were playing this game over Thanksgiving, and I had noticed that whoever had to keep the score was distracted by all
the calculations after each round. Also, it is quite easy to make a mistake. So I had decided to write this program to
help with that.
